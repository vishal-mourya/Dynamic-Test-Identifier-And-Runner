// Good
async function analyzeCodeChanges(prData) {
  const changedFiles = await fetchChangedFiles(prData);
  return changedFiles.map(file => analyzeFile(file));
}

// Avoid
function x(d) {
  var f = get(d);
  return f.map(y => z(y));
}
```

### HTML/CSS

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Keep CSS organized and commented
- Use consistent class naming conventions
